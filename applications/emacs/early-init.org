#+STARTUP: overview

** disable some bars

The tool bar duplicates functionality already accessible via keybindings and
the menu bar, while the vertical scroll bar wastes horizontal space without
providing useful navigation—line numbers and modeline indicators are more
precise.  Setting these in ~default-frame-alist~ rather than calling
~tool-bar-mode~ / ~scroll-bar-mode~ avoids a brief flash of the bars during
startup before the modes disable them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)
#+end_src

** turn off the annoying bell

The default audible bell is distracting and provides no actionable
information.  Replacing it with ~ignore~ silences it entirely; a visual
bell (~visible-bell~) was not chosen because the screen flash is equally
disruptive.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+end_src

** disable backup files

Emacs already skips backup files for version-controlled files by default
(~vc-make-backup-files~ is ~nil~), but files outside of a repository still
produce backups.  Since virtually all editing happens in Git-managed trees,
the remaining cases are rare enough that the clutter outweighs the safety
net.  Auto-save files are likewise redundant when unsaved work can be
recovered through Git stashes or reflog.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq make-backup-files nil)
(setq auto-save-default nil)
#+end_src

** disable lock files

Lock files (~.#filename~) prevent concurrent editing across multiple Emacs
instances, but in a single-instance workflow they only clutter the working
directory and interfere with file watchers and build tools.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq create-lockfiles nil)
#+end_src
